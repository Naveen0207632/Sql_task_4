The above SQL queries analyze data from a `books` table.

1. The first query counts the total number of books in the table.
2. The second calculates the average publication year, excluding null values.
3. The third retrieves the highest and lowest number of available copies among all books.
4. The fourth shows how many books each author has written.
5. The fifth displays the total number of copies available for each genre.
6. The sixth lists genres that have more than one book.
7. The final query identifies authors who have written more than one book.
   These queries help summarize and filter the dataset based on useful library metrics.
